# Open Source Software - Spring 2022
## Javier Portorreal

## Bio
I am a senior CS major (graduating Spring '22). I'm interested in webdesign and I plan on doing Software Engineering when I move into full-time work. 

I like to play a few video games, dance, and learn languages (nothing too serious). If you're into astrology, I am a Scorpio Sun, Libra Moon, and Libra Rising.
